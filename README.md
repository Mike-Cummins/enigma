# Enigma Self-Eval

### Functionality

- I feel that I am at a 3. I have an Enigma class with working encrypt/decrypt methods and CLI.

### Object Oriented Programming

- I feel that I am at a 3. I have an Enigma class with encrypt and decrypt methods, as well as a KeyGenerator class that, well...generates keys, among other things. I could've probably used a module instead and would've liked to have more time exploring refactoring.

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics

- I feel that I am at a 3. My formatting is proper (or should be, thanks rubocop!) I have a few methods that are a little longer/more repetitve than I would like, but nothing over 10 lines. Again, I would like to refactor them but I didn't allow myself the time I should have. I feel that looking at my code, it is easy to understand what is happening and it is easy to follow. 

### Test Driven Development

- I feel that I am at a 3. I would like to have incorporated mocks and stubbs, but I didn't allow myself the time. Another missed refactor opportunity. I have all of my methods tested (maybe not perfect tests) and simplecov coverage report is 100%. I did not address edge cases however. So maybe 2.5 for TDD.

### Version Control

- I feel that I am at a 3. I tried to use branches as much as I could remeber and frequently commit related chunks of code, as well as leave better commit messages and comments in PRs. I know that I have room for improvement in this area.
